# Physics-Portal

<b>Inspiration:
<br>
I collect physics assignments in my class so I wanted to try making it easier to remind people to submit their work

<b>What it does(Description):
<br>
this program has a function for both admin and students. Admins are able to assign new work, send remarks to students and view current submissions of all students. Meanwhile, students are able to see what homework they have due and remarks by admin

<b> How it's built:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Redirects user to either admin or student page depending on login details</li>
    <li>Several features in admin page with navigation bar</li>
    <li>Stores and update inforrmation in database and csv file</li>
    <li>Student can keep track on assignments</li>
    <li>Python, html, css, flask, database and csv were used</li>
</ul>

<b> Challenges encountered:
<br>
I frequently encountered errors and connection issues so I had to spend a lot of time debugging and working around these problems. Also, there was a tight deadline I needed to finish by.

<b> Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
<br>
I really liked the style of my login page because I put in a lot of effort for that. I'm also proud that I finished on time even with the numerous errors and other commitments. Moreover, I managed to work out the logic of the several functions that I thought of and also incorporated csv and databases into it.

<b> What I learned:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Debugging code through careful observation and reasearch</li>
  <li>Combining databases with webpages to transfer and store data dynamically </li>
  <li>Balance multiple commitments</li>
  <li>Beating procastination and really focusing</li>
</ul>

<b> What's next
I might add new features in the future like 'Remember me' and 'Forgot password?' but for now, I will be focusing on properly formatting the student and admin page using CSS.
